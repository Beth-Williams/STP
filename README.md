**Description:**

Sailing Trip Planner is a Windows Form Application, written in C#, using Visual Studio Community 2015.  It was designed using Windows 10 OS on a PC.  

This particular application is tailored to my previously owned sailboat, a 1967 Cal 25, moored at Squalicum Harbor, where majority of my trips occur in and around the San Juan Islands area.

This application is not meant to be used as a replacement to proper Navigation resources, and is primarily useful as an aid,  and a planning tool when navigation resources are not available.
